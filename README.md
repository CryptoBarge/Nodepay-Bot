## üîì Authorization Modes

The `authorization` setting in `settings.yaml` can be set to `"api"` or `"browser"`.

‚ñ´Ô∏è **`"api"`** ‚Äì Authorization is performed via API requests.  
Requires selecting a `captcha_service` with a pre-funded balance.  
A reCAPTCHA token is used for login and is valid for **14 days**.  
Each new token consumes captcha balance.

‚ñ´Ô∏è **`"browser"`** ‚Äì Authorization is performed by launching a Chromium-based browser on your device.  
No captcha cost ‚Äî only proxy traffic is used.  
On average: **~2 GB per 2000 accounts**.

üí° `browser_threads` defines how many browser windows can run in parallel.  
Choose the value based on your system‚Äôs performance ‚Äî powerful devices can handle **8 to 16** browsers simultaneously.

> üîß Note: `threads` and `browser_threads` can be configured independently.

> üìä Farming 2000 accounts uses ~35 MB/s per hour.
